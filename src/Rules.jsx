            <li>Choose a difficult level you want to play</li>
            <li>If you choose "normal", you have 6 times to guess a 6-letter word;
                if you choose "hard", you have 5 times to guess a 7-letter word
            </li>
            <li>The color of the tiles will tell you how close your guess is to the word: 
                "green" means the letter is in the word and in the correct spot;
                "yellow" means the letter is in the word but in the wrong spot;
                "grey" means the letter is not in the word
            </li>
            <li>If you enter the right word, you win; if you've used up all the attempts, you lose.
                Either way, the game goes to the next round
